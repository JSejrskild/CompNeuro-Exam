## Repilcating a neural network in the Basal Ganglia
This project will attempt to replicate the Multiple categorisation system (COVIS) that is described in the paper "A neuropsychological theory of multiple systems in category learning" by Ashby et. al.

## The model
The model will represent a dual processing system in categorisation. 
One direct route through the basal ganglia (striatum) and one (one-dimentional) route though a verbal rule in the prefrontal lobe. 
These two processing pathways will both try to find the optimal rule to an arbitrary visual rule in a categorisation task.
