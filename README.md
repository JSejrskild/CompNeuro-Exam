## Repilcating a neural network in the Basal Ganglia
This project will attempt to replicate the Multiple categorisation system (COVIS) that is described in the paper  "A neuropsychological theory of multiple systems in category learning" by Ashby et. al.

## The model
The model will simulate a dual-process system involved in categorization.
One pathway operates via the basal ganglia (specifically the striatum), implementing a non-verbal categorization strategy.
The other relies on a one-dimensional, verbal rule processed in the prefrontal cortex.
Both pathways will independently attempt to identify the optimal rule for an arbitrary visual categorization task.
